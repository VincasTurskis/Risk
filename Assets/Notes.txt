Template design pattern (should be) used for the different types of players (human and different AI's)
Started in Unity, considering moving to another engine due to Unity's fuckups.
Issue: the rewards of trading in cards are not correct: the reward increases globally when any player trades their cards in, instead of each player being on a different reward stage.
Solved!

Still to do:
Saving system

Camera control/zoom

Make sure player classes do not have access to other player's hands (currently can be done by territory.Owner.GetCardHand()).
Instead, make the hand fully private, and write a function like ShowCardHandOnScreen(Player p), which would display p's hand on the UI panel. Called by human players at start of round and after trade-in.

2-player game (neutral army setup)

PassiveAI deploy troops (randomly)
